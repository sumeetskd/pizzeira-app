css:
1. It is used for the decoration of the page.
2. There are 3 types of CSS:
    1. Inline CSS: When we declare the css at the same place of html,
                   it is called as an inline css.
    2. Internal CSS: When we declare the css inside the <style> tag, under the <head> section
    3. External CSS: When we create a separate .css file and
                    include it in our page using the <link rel="stylesheet" href="location"> tag

IMP: When the different style is provided to the same html element using:
     inline css, internal css and external css, preference given to the inline css.

3. There are different types of selector, out of which some commonly used are id, class and element selector.
4. When we want to apply some style to the perticular html element we use element selector as 
    h1{
        color: red;
    }
    In this case all the h1 element in the page will appear in the red color.

5. When we want to apply some style to the selected html elements we make use of id selector.
    id selector is created using # - symbol

6. When we want to apply same style to the same style to the multople html elemnt of the same type our different type we use class selector.
    Class Selector is created using "." - symbol.
7. The advantage of selector: we can reuse the stylesheet 
8. We can apply multiple css class to single html elements, but the style written in the last class will be applied to the page.
