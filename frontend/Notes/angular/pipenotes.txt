What is Pipe?

Pipes are simple functions to use in template expressions
to accept an input value and return a transformed value.

Use pipes to transform strings, currency amounts, dates, and other data for display.

For example, you would use a pipe to show a date as April 15, 1988 rather than the raw string format. 


built-in pipes for data formatting:

DatePipe: Formats a date value according to locale rules.
UpperCasePipe: Transforms text to all upper case.
LowerCasePipe: Transforms text to all lower case.
CurrencyPipe: Transforms a number to a currency string, formatted according to locale rules.
DecimalPipe: Transforms a number into a string with a decimal point, formatted according to locale rules.
PercentPipe: Transforms a number to a percentage string, formatted according to locale rules.



Using a pipe in a template
To apply a pipe, use the pipe operator (|) within a template expression as shown in the following code example,
along with the name of the pipe, which is date for the built-in DatePipe. The tabs in the example show the following:

-> app.component.html uses date in a separate template to display a birthday.
-> hero-birthday1.component.ts uses the same pipe as part of an in-line template in a component that also sets the birthday value.

eg: 


1. DatePipe
app.component.html
<p>The hero's birthday is {{ birthday | date }}</p>

HeroBirthdayComponet.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-hero-birthday',
  template: "<p>The hero's birthday is {{ birthday | date:'MM/dd/YY' }}</p>"
})
export class HeroBirthdayComponent {
  birthday = new Date(1988, 3, 15); // April 15, 1988 -- since month parameter is zero-based
}

2. Date+UpperCase and Date+Lowercase

app.component.html
<p>The hero's birthday is {{ birthday | date | uppercase}}</p>
<p>The hero's birthday is {{ birthday | date | lowercase}}</p>

HeroBirthdayComponet.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-hero-birthday',
  template: "<p>The hero's birthday is {{ birthday | date:'MM/dd/YY' }}</p>"
})
export class HeroBirthdayComponent {
  birthday = new Date(1988, 3, 15); // April 15, 1988 -- since month parameter is zero-based
}


3. Currency Pipe:-
 use the CurrencyPipe with a country code such as EUR as a parameter. 
 The template expression {{ amount | currency:'EUR' }} transforms the amount to currency in euros.
 Follow the pipe name (currency) with a colon (:) and the parameter value ('EUR').
eg: 

template:-
<p>The hero's birthday is {{ amount | currency:'EUR':'Euros '}} </p>

class:-
amount:number=123;


4. Slice:
For example, 
{{ slice:1:5 }} creates a new array or string containing a subset of the elements starting with element 1 and ending with element 5.
