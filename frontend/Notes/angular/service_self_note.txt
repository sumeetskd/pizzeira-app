Service:
1. Only contains business logic for the code.
How to create:
app->course->course.service.ts

service.ts:-
export class CourseService{
	getCourse():string[]{
		return ['a','b','abc'];
	}

}

goto component.ts:-
1. import ur service
2. add the dependency injection: to let the compiler know that we are using a serice
and we don't need to make tight coupling.
	add the metadata: provider:[CourseService]
3. to use the service:-
	Inside the componentClass:-
	1.create an variable to store the data that is to be returned by the service method.
	2. public course;	->any datatype: as we don't know the type of data ie to be returned by the srvice
	3. call the service using a constructor:-
		constructor(courseService:CourseService){
			this.course = courseService.getCourse();
		}
